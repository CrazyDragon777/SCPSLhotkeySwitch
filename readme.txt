this program changes the hotkeys for SCP: Secret Laboratory to
something that doesn't suck.it won't change the keys for any other
window, only SCP:SL

defaults:
movement from wasd --> esdf
interact is middle mouse button
walk is z
voice chat is capslock

just edit the script and recompile it if you want to change anything
it's all commented and it's like 20 lines long anyways. also you can
change #IfWinActive SCP: Secret Laboratory to #IfWinActive *other program*
if you want to switch it to a different window

also i have no idea if you need autohotkey installed to run the exe. i think
you can just run the exe but who knows
